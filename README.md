# GeneticAlgorithmMutations

This project is about exploring different mutation patterns using the one point crossover or the uniform crossover and understand which one performs better.

The concept is based on evolution and understanding whether why some patterns of mutation are better than others i.e - which genetics survive and which die off.

## Creation Info
The project was created in Eclipse IDE, written in Java.

## Conclustion
After testing, the uniform crossover generated better results. More insights can be found from the spreadsheets listed in the repo
